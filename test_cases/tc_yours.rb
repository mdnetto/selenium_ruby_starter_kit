# This file is where you should paste tests you have created with the Selenium IDE.

# 0. If you haven't done so already, delete the test_cases/google_examples directory
# 0. Record a test using the Selenium IDE
# 0. Once you are satisfied with your test, click on Options > Format > Ruby - Selenium RC
# 0. Copy the test_new function and paste it into test_cases/tc_yours.rb
# 0. Run the following command
#     ruby ts_run_all_tests.rb http://site_you_are_testing.com

# It is a good practice to rename your test_new function to something else -- test_mumble, test_foo, test_whatever -- as long as the name still begins with 'test_'.
